Connector ecosystem for Olake, the key points Olake Connectors focuses on are these
- **Integrated Writers to avoid block of reading, and pushing directly into destinations**
- **Connector Autonomy**
- **Avoid operations that don't contribute to increasing record throughput**

## Performance Benchmarks*
1. **MongoDB Connector:** Syncs 35,694 records/sec; 230 million rows in 46 minutes for a 664 GB dataset (20× Airbyte, 15× Embedded Debezium, 6× Fivetran) -> ([See Detailed Benchmark](https://olake.io/docs/connectors/mongodb/benchmarks))  
2. **Postgres Connector:**  Syncs 1,000,000 records/sec for 50GB -> ([See Detailed Benchmark](https://olake.io/docs/connectors/postgres/benchmarks))  
3. **MySQL Connector:** Syncs 1,000,000 records/sec for 10GB; ~209 mins for 100+GB ->  ([See Detailed Benchmark](https://olake.io/docs/connectors/mysql/benchmarks))  

*These are preliminary performances, we'll published fully reproducible benchmark scores soon.

## Core
Core or framework is the component/logic that has been abstracted out from Connectors to follow DRY. This includes base CLI commands, State logic, Validation logic, Type detection for unstructured data, handling Config, State, Streams, and Writer config file, logging etc.

Core includes http server that directly exposes live stats about running sync such as:
- Possible finish time
- Concurrently running processes
- Live record count

Core handles the commands to interact with a driver via these:
- `spec` command: Returns render-able JSON Schema that can be consumed by rjsf libraries in frontend
- `check` command: performs all necessary checks on the Config, Streams, State and Writer config
- `discover` command: Returns all streams and their schema
- `sync` command: Extracts data out of Source and writes into destinations
